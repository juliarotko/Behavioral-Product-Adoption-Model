# Agent-Based Market-Product Adoption Model

This ongoing project explores the dynamics of product adoption using **agent-based modelling (ABM)**.  
It simulates how customer behavior, brand influence, and social networks interact to shape market outcomes.

## Overview

The model integrates:
- **Agent heterogeneity:** customers vary in traits like risk aversion, innovation interest, and social dependence.  
- **Network effects:** adoption decisions are influenced by connected agents in a Barabási–Albert network.  
- **Behavioral factors:** price sensitivity, loyalty, and innovation drive decision-making.

## Current Features
- Implementation of `Customer`, `Brand`, `Product`, and `Market` classes.  
- Randomized market generation and parameter analysis.  
- Visualization of customer networks and parameter distributions.  
- Preliminary threshold vs. score comparison for early adoption analysis.

## Next Steps
*This project is ongoing.*  
Upcoming work includes:
- Deeper analysis of network diffusion patterns.  
- Extension of the adoption decision algorithm by correlated traits.  
- Validation and visualization of multi-product competition dynamics.

## Tools & Libraries
Python • NumPy • Matplotlib • Seaborn • NetworkX • pandas

> *Developed as part of a personal research project on market diffusion and behavioral modeling.  
Further analyses and model extensions are in progress.*
